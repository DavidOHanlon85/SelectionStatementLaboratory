<h1>Selection Statement Laboratory</h1>

<h2>Part 1</h2>

Output to the console and operators (use of printf)
Write a Java program to accomplish each of the following tasks:
1.	Prompt the user for a decimal point number.
2.	Assign the number to a suitable variable.
3.	The output of the program should match the following…..

Note: You will need to perform several maths operations to produce the required output. But there are in-built Java functions that would allow you to do some of these (Hint java.lang.Math)  
Also always try to write efficient code... do you need to create a new variable to store the result of each operation before outputting to the console? 

<h2>Part 2 - Masters grading</h2>
 
Write a Java program to accomplish each of the following tasks:

1.	Prompt the user of the program for a final mark for a Masters student (between 0 – 100).
2.	Assign the number entered to a suitable variable.
3.	Using only IF .. ELSE statements output the Masters Classification corresponding to the number entered by the user.

0-49 		Fail
  	
50-59		Pass

60-69		Merit

70-100		Distinction

Note : if the user enters a number outside the range output a suitable error message

Remember to Test your program.

<h2>Part 3 - Voting System with Age Check Validation</h2>

Prompt the user for his/her age.  Then check if the user is over 17.  If so, then prompt the user for a name.  Then output the user’s inputted name and age.  Otherwise, if not over 17 then output “too young to continue” (i.e. do not prompt for name).  In addition, ensure that the user does not enter a negative number or 0 for age. (if so exit the program gracefully with “sorry don’t recognise your input”.

Use an if … else statement:  to check a user input value into a voting system.  The user should be presented with two options ‘con’ and ‘lab’.  (Representing Conservative and Labour).  If the entry is con then output “Voting registered for Conservative” and “Voting registered for Labour” upon ‘lab’ entry.  Ignore the case that the user enters these values.  
(Your program should use the conditional operator to help convert the input value (con or lab) to Labour or Conservative respectively.

Also, add some validation to ensure the user cannot register a vote if they type any other entry(see below).
